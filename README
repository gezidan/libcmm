README update 28 April 2011:

This branch of libcmm is integrating my port to C++ along with a number
of changes to get libcmm ready for additional features and a release.

At Ralf's suggestion, identifiers everywhere are now using the cmm_ prefix
instead of the mm_ prefix, because mm_ was already taken by another library.

The C++ compile forced the addition of a number of C99 macros to get
compilation with C++ as well as C99. I've probably broken the C99 version
for now; this is just an intermediate checkin.
